# Space Breaker
> A copy of the classical Block Breaker

Created using [Unity](https://unity3d.com)

Never forget the classics! In this version of Block Breaker the player is meat to destroy the blocks while in the space. Objects falls from the space like meteorites, comets and others. Even a Meteor and an astronaut flying through the sky are your mates in this adventure!

Once the game is still in development, there are some images not proper to the Space. Soon new versions will come with proper evolution on gameplay.
